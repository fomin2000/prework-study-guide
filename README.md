## Description

- My motivation to build this study guide was to succefully complete this bootcamp to be able to succeed in the real world!
- This project overlooks everything I've learned so far in the prework and will act as a study guide.
- It helps clearly navigate to the tips that will be needed while continuing the learning process.
- I have learned various topics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And mostly learned how the Git Flow works.
